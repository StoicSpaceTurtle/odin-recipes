        <p>This website is my first attempt to code a website entirely through html and css using Visual Code Studio. Due to my lack of coding finesse, this website will unintentionally be brutalist. Nevertheless, I will still attempt to apply good design.</p>

        <p>Originally titled &apos;Odin Recipes&apos;, this website was an assignment from The Odin Project to build an online recipe resource of sort. However, upon being tasked to improve the website via css, I&apos;m taking the opportunity to create something new. This blank slate of a website would make a perfect canvas to touch on the subject of modern art. But being my first project, I want to create something more personal. This may well be my venture to a new life as a coder (what ever that translates to).</p>

        <p>I dedicate this website to my son, Umar. Love you buddy. This is <strong>Lego Man</strong>.</p>
