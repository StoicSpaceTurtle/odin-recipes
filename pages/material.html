        <h2 class="header sub">Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS)</h2>
        <p>ABS is the material that LEGO uses to make the class brick as well as DUPLO. It is a hard plastic that is scratch resistant and perfect for achieving clutch between bricks.</p>
        <br />

        <h2 class="header sub">High Impact Polystyrene (HIPS)</h2>
        <p>HIPS are what is used to make baseplates. It possesses good rigidity and stiffness, allowing it to maintain its shape and structural integrity even under external forces. This attribute makes it suitable for applications that require structural support and stability. It can be easily molded, extruded, or thermoformed, allowing for complex shapes and designs to be produced efficiently.</p>

        <img class="thumbnail" src="../images/Lego-gear.jpeg">
        <h2 class="header sub">Polyamide (PA)</h2>
        <p>PA is a type of material that can withstand high loads and impacts. This means it is suitable for elements that need to be tough and able to interact with each other, for example gearwheels and different connectors.</p>
        <br />

        <h2 class="header sub">Methyl Methacrylate Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (MABS)</h2>
        <p>MABS is similar to ABS but used specifically to make elements that need to be transparent, such as windscreens, light saber blades and transparent plates.</p>
        <br />
        <img class="thumbnail" src="../images/Lego-leaf.jpeg">
        <h2 class="header sub">Polyethylene (PE)</h2>
        <p>PE is a soft, durable, and flexible material that LEGO makes from sustainably sourced sugarcane. It comes in two different variants; HDPE which is a tough and flexible material used for elements such as flags and limb elements, and LDPE which is less stiff and often used for small flexible elements. PE elements are made from 98% plant-based materials.</p>

        <h2 class="header sub">Styrene Ethylene Butylene Styrene (SEBS)</h2>
        <p>SEBS is a soft and elastic material that LEGO uses to make tires.</p>
